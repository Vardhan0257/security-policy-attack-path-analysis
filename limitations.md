## Limitations

1. The system does not model time-based or context-aware IAM conditions.
2. Stateful firewall behavior is not simulated.
3. The framework does not perform live exploitation or vulnerability scanning.
4. Scalability to enterprise-scale environments is out of scope.
5. Risk scores are heuristic-based and intended for prioritization only.
