## Assumptions

1. The system analyzes a snapshot of security policies at a given point in time.
2. Policies are modeled conservatively to identify potential, not guaranteed, attack paths.
3. IAM policies are limited to basic Allow and Deny effects without conditional clauses.
4. Network rules are treated as stateless and directional.
5. The modeled environment is representative, not exhaustive.
6. Identified attack paths require human validation for exploitability.
